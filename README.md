# Wrangle-and-Analyze-Data
>Fourth project in Udacity Data Analyst NanoDegree

Real-world data is rarely accurate. I will collect data in a variety of forms and sources using Python and its libraries, evaluate its quality and tidiness, and then clean it. We call this "data wrangling." I'll keep track of my data wrangling activities in a Jupyter Notebook and present them using Python analyses and visualizations. The dataset that I will be wrangling (and analyzing and visualizing) is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates , also known as WeRateDogs . WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog.
